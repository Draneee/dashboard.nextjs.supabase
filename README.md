## Set up a Supabase project

Head over to [database.new](https://database.new/) and create a new Supabase project.
When your project is up and running...

### Declare Supabase Environment Variables
Rename .env.local.example to .env.local and populate with your Supabase connection variables.
ou can get them from the [dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
